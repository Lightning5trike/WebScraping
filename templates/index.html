    <h3>Fibres</h3>
    <p>When choosing yarn for a project it is important to consider what qualities you are looking for in a yarn. Below the 3 main types of yarn have been outlined and from here you can decide what types of yarn you would like for your project.</p>
    <h4>Animal Fibres</h4>
    <p>Animal fibers are known for their warmth and insulating properties but are avoided by vegan makers or those with certain allergies.</p>
    <p>They are typically very warm, very soft, breathable, and quite stretchy. On the negative side, they can also pill and felt, and are not machine washable.</p>
    <p>Examples: Sheep wool, alpaca, yak, mohair, angora, cashmere, camel, qiviut, slik.</p>
    
    <h4>Plant Fibres</h4>
    <p>Plant fibers require some processing to turn raw materials into yarn. While plant fibers share commone qualities like moisture-wicking and easy care, they also share some negative traits, like heaviness and inelasticity.</p>
    <p>They are usually not very warm, can absorb a lot of water, some of them have an excellent stitch definition, and they are often machine washable. They are not very stretchy and can be more difficult to knit with.</p>
    <p>Examples: Cotton, linen, nettle, bamboo.</p>
    
    <h4>Synthetic Fibres</h4>
    <p>Synthetic fibers are made using chemical processes rather than naturally-occurring substances. While typically easier to find and care for, more makers are considering the environmental impact of synthetic yarns before purchase.</p>
    <p>Often very inexpensive, quite soft, and quite versatile. But not breathable at all, and often not the highest comfort factor.</p>
    <p>Examples: Nylon, Acrylic, Polyamid.</p>
